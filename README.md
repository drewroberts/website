## Projects

[Bear Fund](https://t.me/BearFund) is my launchpad for projects during the upcoming cryptocurrency cycle.

## Installation

After setting up local dev environment with PHP 7.4, you will launch this Laravel 8 app by copying the ``.env.example`` file to ``.env``

From there, create the ``website`` database in MySQL and from the command line run the following commands:

```bash
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan key:generate
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can then view the homepage if you're using Laravel Homestead at https://website.test and can access Laravel Nova at http://website.test/admin
